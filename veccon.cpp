    //2ND FUNCTION
    //Find distance of every nearby coil within radial distance
    //Loop through addresses and add to a data structure
    //Determine coils that are within 1 to 3.5cm

    //Store all coils within that distance in a data structure
        //Check if it is a deadzone
        //If it is a deadzone, stall the program for () secs. Do not power on any coils


    //3RD FUNCTION    
    //Determine angle
        //Check if x < 0
            //If true, multiply x and y by -1
            //Compute arctan(y/x) and add 180 to the result
            //Return the angle
        //Otherwise
            //Computer arctan(y/x)
            //Return the angle

    //Output the result
